#Scraper for Bulbapedia
The aim of this program is to extract information on Pokemons such as their name,type,abilities,stats.... from bulbpapedia.com to create a database of all relevant data on them.
This data will act as the foundation for a future data analytics project. I will analyze decisions made by veteran players of an online indie game called Pokemon Showdown to generate more such affective teams.

#The web scraper will extract the following data from bulbapedia:
1. Pokemon ID
2. Name
3. Type
4. Abilities
5. HP (Health Points)
6. Attack
7. Defence
8. Special Attack
9. Special Defence
10. Speed
11. Base Stat Total
12. Weight
13. Height
